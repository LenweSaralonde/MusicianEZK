# MusicianEZK
Play live in Musician using a simplified keyboard based on the Guid Wars 2 bindings.

This aims to be an alternative to [Ayalaes's Musician Options](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/musicianoptions-ayalaes) that is no longer maintained.

It's still a work in progress. Feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ypfpGxK) to discuss about the plugin.

## Bindings
* 1-8 or NUMPAD1-NUMPAD8 : Play note
* 9 or NUMPAD9 or LEFT : Octave down
* 0 or NUMPAD0 or RIGHT : Octave up
* SPACE (hold) : Sustain
* SHIFT + 1-8 : Toggle note semitone shift.  You can't shift a key if the resulting note is the same as the one next to it.
